# git and GitHub

While git is a DVCS, GitHub is an online hosting provider for git repositories.

Git is basically a command-line piece of software. Experienced git users typically spend most or all of their time managing their repositories in the command prompt. Git works by tracking individual files in a repository. A repository is simply a folder that may have files and sub-folders. Two commonly used configuration files can be placed at the root of a repository - "*.gitignore*" and "*.gitattributes*". A repository can be configured to ignore (not track) certain kinds of files or folders (such as binary files) using the settings in ".gitignore". The ".gitattributes" file is for other configuration settings, such as telling git how to treat new line characters ([little endian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Little-endian) or [big endian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Big-endian)).

There are graphical programs to make working with git easier (at least, for beginners). GitHub has produced their own graphical tool for Windows and Mac users. These graphical programs typically have an option to launch a command prompt to directly enter git commands.
