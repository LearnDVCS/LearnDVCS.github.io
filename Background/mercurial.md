## DVCS: git vs. Mercurial

In the world of DVCS, there are two top software products for doing DVCS: [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) and [git](http://git-scm.com/). While the underlying implementations of Mercurial and git differ, they are generally the same on the surface (at least, for beginning developers). For years, the Mercurial DVCS has been more popular among Windows users while git has been for the *nix and Mac users. With the use of online hosting for DVCS repositories (through sites such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Kiln](https://www.fogcreek.com/kiln/)) and, more specifically, the release of platform-independent client-side tools such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (formerly GitHub for Windows and GitHub for Mac), git has become the most popular DVCS in use today.
