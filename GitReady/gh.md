With your school-issued email added to your account, you can now click the **Request a Discount** button at [Education.GitHub.com](https://education.github.com/). Just identify yourself as a *student*, and request the discount for and *individual account*. If your school is a recognized post-secondary institution, your discount is likely to be approved in a few minutes. With that discount, you can create private repositories for any school projects that are worth marks.

> WARNING: Whenever putting any school-related work that is worth marks on GitHub, make sure you have it in a **private repository** so that others can't see it. This is all part of ensuring that you are holding to principles of **Academic Integrity**. Be sure to check with your instructor to see if it's ok for you to use GitHub private repositories to store your work.
