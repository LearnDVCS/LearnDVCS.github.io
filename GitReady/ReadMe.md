# Setting Up for Version Control

To use version control in your work, you need a version control system. That is to say, you need a program that can save "versions" of what you have been working on.

There are many version control systems out there, but the one we are interested in here is called **git**. Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS). You can install git on your computer, and you can also use an online git hosting service such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/). For our purposes, we will be using both GitHub and git installed on your computer.
